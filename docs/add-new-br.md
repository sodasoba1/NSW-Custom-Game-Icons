Manually adding icons you have made or saved to your system is also possible and quite simple

click `Add New` be sure `Manual` is selected choose the `Icon Style` you are adding
then locate the image you want to add by finally clicking `Browse`

#![add-new](<img/add-newbr1.png>)

once you have chosen the image before finding the title ID you *may* need to add the icon name or shorten it to be sucessful in finding a matching ID

!!! Notes
	in the example I have called the icon Taiko No Tatsujin
	rather than the full name

#![add-new](<img/add-newbr2.png>)

clicking `Find...` you can search via CSV which is a litle of titles installed on the switch
or via JSON which is a online titleID database

choose the game that matches the icon you are adding

#![add-new](<img/add-newbr3.png>)

you will now have a updated Icon Name & Title ID check everything is correct and click `Add`
#![add-new](<img/add-newbr4.png>)

Everything will now be ready as the icon is added to your output window ready for transferring
